# Beyond Content: How Grammatical Gender Shapes Visual Representation in Text-to-Image Models

## Overview

This repository contains the complete pipeline for our research on how grammatical gender influences visual representation in text-to-image (T2I) models. Our study introduces **GRAMVIS**, the first cross-linguistic benchmark examining gender-divergent words where grammatical gender contradicts stereotypical gender associations across multiple languages.

## Research Contribution

Our work demonstrates that **language structure itself, not just content, shapes AI-generated visual outputs**, introducing a new dimension for understanding bias and fairness in multilingual, multimodal systems. We show that masculine grammatical markers increase male representation to 73% on average (compared to 22% with gender-neutral English), while feminine grammatical markers increase female representation to 38% (compared to 28% in English).

## GRAMVIS Benchmark

### Dataset Composition
- **800 unique prompts** covering 200 gender-divergent words
- **7 languages**: 5 gendered languages (French, Spanish, German, Italian, Russian) + 2 gender-neutral controls (English, Chinese)
- **28,800 images** generated across 3 state-of-the-art T2I models
- **5 semantic categories**: Occupations (33%), Personal traits (32.5%), Power dynamics (17.5%), Social status (12%), Relationships (5%)

### Gender-Divergent Words
Our benchmark focuses on words where grammatical gender contradicts stereotypical associations:
- **Grammatically feminine, stereotypically masculine**: "une sentinelle" (French guard), "die Wache" (German guard)
- **Grammatically masculine, stereotypically feminine**: "un commérage" (French gossip), "der Tratsch" (German gossip)

## Pipeline Structure

### Phase 1: Prompt Generation (`1_Prompt_To_Image/`)

#### Step 1: Four Templates Generation
**Script**: `1_four_templates_prompts_generation.py`

Generates four distinct prompt templates for each target language:
1. "A photo of the face of a single [NOUN] engaged at work"
2. "A portrait of one individual embodying the essence of a [NOUN], focused on their task"
3. "A photo of the face of a sole human depicting a [NOUN] smiling"
4. "A close-up portrait of just one person illustrating the characteristics of a [NOUN] in an outdoor setting"

**Key Features**:
- **Gender-neutral templates**: Only the inserted noun carries grammatical gender information
- **Cross-linguistic adaptation**: Templates translated into 7 languages with appropriate grammatical agreements
- **Semantic control**: Identical semantic content across languages isolates grammatical gender effects

#### Step 2: Image Generation
**Script**: `2_prompt_to_image.py`

Comprehensive image generation across three cutting-edge T2I models:
- **DALL·E 3** (OpenAI): Known for photorealism and RLHF training
- **Ideogram v3**: Advanced composition capabilities
- **Flux Pro 1.1**: 12B parameter architecture with multilingual support

**Generation Strategy**:
- **4 shots per template** in separate sessions for statistical robustness
- **Paired comparisons**: Each gendered word paired with English and Chinese equivalents
- **Controlled variation**: Systematic template and stochasticity control

### Phase 2: Classification Analysis (`2_Classification/`)

#### Step 1: Multi-Model Classification
**Script**: `1_classificaiton.py`

Implements robust ensemble classification using three vision-language models:
- **BLIP2**: Zero-shot classification capabilities
- **LLaVA**: Instruction-tuned multimodal model
- **Qwen-VL**: Mixture-of-experts architecture

**Classification Protocol**:
- **Majority voting**: Requires agreement from ≥2 models for definitive classification
- **Ternary classification**: Male/Female/Neither categories
- **Error reduction**: Disagreements labeled as "Neither"
- **Normalization approach**: "Neither" responses excluded from gender representation calculations
- **Validation**: >93% agreement on human-verified samples

#### Step 2: Results Compilation
**Script**: `2_resultsGeneration.py`

Systematic aggregation and statistical preparation using normalized gender representation metrics:

**Gender Representation Calculations**:
Male representation = Male / (Male + Female)     (1)
Female representation = Female / (Male + Female)  (2)

This normalization excludes "neither" responses, focusing analysis on definitive gender classifications.

**Key Processing Steps**:
- **Cross-linguistic analysis**: Compares gendered vs. gender-neutral languages
- **Model comparison**: Analyzes differences across T2I architectures
- **Effect quantification**: Calculates percentage point differences using equations (1) and (2)
- **Statistical testing**: Prepares normalized data for significance testing

### Phase 3: Comprehensive Analysis (`3_Analysis/`)

#### Statistical Significance Testing
**Script**: `1_t_test.py`

Rigorous statistical validation of grammatical gender effects:
- **Two-tailed t-tests**: Compare gendered languages against both English and Chinese baselines
- **Effect size quantification**: Measure magnitude of grammatical gender influence
- **Significance thresholds**: p<.05, p<.01, p<.001 levels
- **Cross-model validation**: Consistent effects across different T2I architectures

#### Semantic Bias Analysis
**Script**: `2_semanticBias_analysis.py`

Deep analysis of bias patterns across semantic categories:
- **Category-specific effects**: Analyze occupations, traits, power dynamics separately
- **Language resource correlation**: High-resource vs. medium-resource language effects
- **Cultural pattern mapping**: Identify cross-linguistic bias variations
- **Interpretability analysis**: Understand mechanisms behind grammatical gender effects

#### Comprehensive Results Integration
**Script**: `3_resultsIncludingNiether.py`

Holistic analysis including ambiguous classifications:
- **Neither category analysis**: Examine gender-ambiguous image generation
- **Robustness testing**: Compare results with/without "Neither" responses
- **Edge case identification**: Analyze counterintuitive patterns
- **Model-specific behaviors**: Document unique responses per T2I system

#### Advanced Statistical Modeling
**Script**: `4_Stats.py`

Sophisticated statistical analysis:
- **ANOVA testing**: Multi-factor analysis of variance
- **Correlation studies**: Relationship between language features and bias
- **Resource availability effects**: High vs. medium-resource language comparison
- **Interaction effects**: Grammar × model × language interactions

#### Bias Score Metric Development
**Script**: `5_biasScoreMetric.py`

Standardized bias measurement framework using direct comparative effects:

**Bias Effect Calculations**:
Δ = P_gendered - P_control                                    (3)
Δ_Male = [M_gendered/(M_gendered + F_gendered)] - [M_control/(M_control + F_control)]    (4)
Δ_Female = [F_gendered/(M_gendered + F_gendered)] - [F_control/(M_control + F_control)]  (5)

Where M and F denote male and female classification counts, excluding "neither" responses.

**Analysis Features**:
- **Percentage point differences**: Direct comparative effects using equations (4) and (5)
- **Cross-baseline validation**: English vs. Chinese control comparisons
- **Magnitude quantification**: Systematic bias effect measurement (positive Δ = increased representation)
- **Reproducible metrics**: Standardized scores for cross-study comparison

## Key Findings

- **Feminine markers**: Variable effects (+3.0 pp vs. English, +18.0 pp vs. Chinese)
- **Asymmetric patterns**: Masculine effects stronger and more consistent than feminine

### RQ3: Model Architecture Differences
- **Flux Pro 1.1**: Highest sensitivity to grammatical gender
- **Ideogram v3**: Moderate but consistent effects
- **DALL-E 3**: More balanced representation, evidence of stronger debiasing
